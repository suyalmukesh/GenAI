Matplotlib is known as the "GrandFather" of the plotting and visualization libraries for Python. 

Many other visualization libraries are built directly off of Matplotlib (e.g , seaborn and pandas built-in visualization )

Matplotlib is heavily inspired by the plotting function of the MatLab programming language.

It allows for the creation of almost any plot type and heavy customization.
